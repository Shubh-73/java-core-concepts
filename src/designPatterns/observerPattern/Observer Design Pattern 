Observer design pattern is implemented here taking the example of cricket scores updates.

In observer pattern, there are two main entities -> subject and observer.

There are certain functionalities with subject like:

    1. register all the observers who want to receive the updates about the change
        of state of the subject

    2. remove all those observers who no longer wish to receive notifications
    3. update the change of state of observer

Then there is an observer which should receive updates about the change of state.

To make both the observer as well as the subject loosely coupled, both of them are
added as an interface with the contract promising the functionalities mentioned above.


Every subject has list of updates and whenever there are any changes, the subject iterates
over all the observers and call its update method and provide new updates.
